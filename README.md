# Stocker

1. **System Purpose**
- Stocker is a financial data processing system designed to fetch, parse, and store stock market trading data.

2. **Key Components & Responsibilities**
- Data Fetching Layer: `YahooFinanceFetcher` and `BaseDataFetcher` handle external API communications
- Parsing Layer: `YahooFinanceParser` and `BaseParser` process raw financial data
- Data Models: `Stock`, `Candlestick`, `TradingPeriod`, `Range`, and `Interval` represent financial data structures
- Database Layer: `CandlestickDao` manages data persistence
- Support: `StockAppLogger` provides system-wide logging capabilities

3. **Core Technologies & Dependencies**
- Java as the primary programming language
- HTTP Client for API communications
- GSON for JSON processing
- SQL database (indicated by JDBC usage)
- Dotenv for environment configuration
- Java Logging framework
- Java Time API for temporal data handling

4. **Architecture**
The system follows a layered architecture:
- Business Logic Layer (data models and processing)
- Data Access Layer (DAO pattern implementation)
- External Services Integration Layer (Yahoo Finance API)

5. **Data Flow**
1. `YahooFinanceFetcher` retrieves raw data from Yahoo Finance API
2. `YahooFinanceParser` transforms the JSON response into domain objects (Candlestick, TradingPeriod)
3. Data is modeled through `Candlestick` and `TradingPeriod` objects
4. `CandlestickDao` persists the processed data to the database
5. `StockAppLogger` tracks operations across all layers
